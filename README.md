# Daydream Scope

![longlivedemo1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa46227-4405-4ad9-9cd7-a53724f0203d)

Scope is a tool for running and customizing real-time, interactive generative AI pipelines and models.

🚧 Here be dragons! This project is currently in **alpha**. 🚧

## Features

- Autoregressive video diffusion models
  - [LongLive](./pipelines/longlive/docs/usage.md)
- WebRTC real-time streaming
- Low latency async video processing pipelines
- UI with text prompting and video/camera input modes

...and more to come!

## System Requirements

Scope currently supports the following operating systems:

- Linux
- Windows

Scope currently requires a Nvidia GPU with >= 24GB VRAM. We recommend a driver that supports CUDA >= 12.8 and a RTX 3090/4090/5090 (newer generations will support higher FPS throughput and lower latency). If you do not have access to a GPU with these specs then we recommend installing on [Runpod](#runpod).

## Install

### Manual Installation

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) which is needed to run the server and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) which is needed to build the frontend.

#### Clone

```
git clone git@github.com:daydreamlive/scope.git
cd scope
```

#### Build

This will build the frontend files which will be served by the Scope server.

```
uv run build
```

#### Run

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are running the server in a cloud environment, make sure to read the [Firewalls](#firewalls) section.

This will start the server and on the first run will also download required model weights. The default directory where model weights are stored is `~/.daydream-scope/models`.

```
uv run daydream-scope
```

After the server starts up, the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Runpod

Use our RunPod template to quickly set up Scope in the cloud. This is the easiest way to get started if you don't have a compatible local GPU.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the instructions in [Firewalls](#firewalls) to get a HuggingFace access token.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. **Click the Runpod template link**: [Template](https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=aca8mw9ivw&ref=5k8hxjq3)

2. **Select your GPU**: Choose a GPU that meets the [system requirements](#system-requirements).

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Click "Edit Template"
   - Add an environment variable:
     - Set name to `HF_TOKEN`
     - Set value to your HuggingFace access token
   - Click "Set Overrides"

4. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy On-Demand"

5. **Access the app**: Wait for deployment to complete, then open the app at port 8000

The template will automatically download model weights and configure everything needed.

## Firewalls

If you run Scope in a cloud environment with restrictive firewall settings (eg. Runpod), Scope supports using [TURN servers](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/turn-server) to establish a connection between your browser and the streaming server.

The easiest way to enable this feature is to create a HuggingFace account and a `read` [access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens). You can then set an environment variable before starting Scope:

```bash
# You should set this to your HuggingFace access token
export HF_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

When you start Scope, it will automatically use Cloudflare's TURN servers and you'll have 10GB of free streaming per month:

```
uv run daydream-scope
```
